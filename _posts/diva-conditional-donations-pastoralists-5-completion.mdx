We are excited to announce the successful conclusion of our [5th campaign](https://www.divadonate.xyz/posts/diva-conditional-donations-pastoralists-5) to **deliver 
anticipatory cash transfers to pastoralist communities in Kenya**. This campaign was conducted in collaboration with Ripple using their new stablecoin RLUSD on 
Ethereum as the payout token. 

**Due to favorable vegetation conditions, no payout was triggered**. Participants can reclaim their contributions by following the steps outlined in 
[this video](https://shorturl.at/uBHLN). These funds can be redeposited in future campaigns to amplify their impact.

Let‚Äôs dive into the details and key learnings from this campaign.


## ‚ú® Campaign overview

The campaign aimed to **assess vegetation health** using the 
[NDVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_difference_vegetation_index#:~:text=The%20normalized%20difference%20vegetation%20index,%3A%20red%20and%20near%2Dinfrared.) 
metric, derived from satellite imagery, at the end of May during Kenya‚Äôs long rainy season (March-June). If the data had indicated vegetation stress, funds would have been 
**automatically disbursed to participating pastoralists** in Laikipia North ‚Äì a drought-prone region ‚Äì to support them financially through the upcoming dry season.

More details can be found in the [original campaign announcement](https://www.divadonate.xyz/posts/diva-conditional-donations-pastoralists-5).


## üêê Pastoralist onboarding

For this campaign, new participants from Laikipia North region were onboarded. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of two village champions, 
**517 pastoralists** were successfully added, 365 of them (~70%) were women.


## ‚ô•Ô∏è Campaign contributions

A total of **$36,709** was contributed, providing coverage of **$71 to each participating pastoralist** ‚Äì e.g., enough to sustain one livestock for six months in case of drought.

**Key funding sources included:**
* **$25,000** grant from Ripple, the headline sponsor of this campaign
* **$11,640** in rolled-over funds from previous campaigns, originally contributed by Mercy Corps Ventures and Arbitrum
* **$67** from six external contributors


## üå± NDVI result

On **31 May 2025**, the NDVI value was recorded at **0.65** (reported as 1.65 for technical reasons). This value exceeded the 
0.61 threshold required to trigger donations, indicating healthy vegetation conditions across the region.

As a result, no payouts were released to beneficiaries in this round


## üí∞ Fund rollover

Since no payouts were triggered, all partner contributions including **Ripple funds have been reclaimed and will be rolled into the next campaign**, 
launching in September and covering the rainy period Oct-Dec 2025.

This demonstrates how **every dollar contributed multiplies its impact** through our need-based approach, ensuring funds are donated only when they are most needed.

## üéñÔ∏è Participant reward

As a token of appreciation, all participants received a POAP, a digital certificate on the blockchain, to commemorate their contribution. Donations of $75 or more got the golden-ring POAP. Smaller contributions received the silver POAP.

## üìö Key learning

### External contributions

As with previous campaigns, external contributors accounted for only a small portion of total funding. While the protocol remains open for public 
donations, the main funding source continues to be strategic partnerships with aligned organizations.
This reinforces our focus going forward to prioritize institutional partnerships that enable us to reach scale, while maintaining the openness 
of the platform for individuals who wish to contribute.

### Pastoralists onboarding

Onboarding new pastoralists involves higher initial acquisition costs, driven by extensive travel requirements and limited transport infrastructure 
in these remote areas. For this reason, onboarding new pastoralists should be done with the clear intent to run repeat campaigns with them, 
over multiple seasons. This ensures that the onboarding costs are spread across several campaigns, reducing the per-campaign cost over time. 
It is important that this dynamic is clearly communicated to partners and carefully factored into campaign planning, especially when expanding 
into new regions or scaling existing regions.

### Auto-roll functionality request
One donor suggested enabling automatic rollover of unused funds into future campaigns, removing the need for manual claiming and redepositing. 
We‚Äôll explore how this can be implemented to streamline the donor experience.


## üìà Impact statistics (since inception)

* **$83,219** has been **contributed** across five campaigns.
* **$11,744** (14%) was **distributed** to beneficiaries (during the Q4 2023 MCV pilot campaign).
* On average, **222 pastoralists** were protected per rainy season, with free coverage worth **$75** each.
