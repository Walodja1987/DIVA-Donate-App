We are excited to announce the [5th iteration of the DIVA Donate campaign](https://www.divadonate.xyz/campaign/pastoralists-5) focused on using web3 
technology in delivering anticipatory cash transfers to pastoral communities in Kenya ahead of drought. 

We are particularly thrilled to share that this coming season's campaign will take place in partnership with Ripple and will utilize Ripple's
new stablecoin, [RLUSD](https://etherscan.io/token/0x8292Bb45bf1Ee4d140127049757C2E0fF06317eD), on Ethereum as the payout token, demonstrating its applicability in humanitarian
aid and disaster relief. The collaboration with Ripple is a testament to the value of our work and the
community's trust in our mission to become the most effective and efficient platform for disaster relief,
powered by blockchain technology. We are deeply honored and incredibly grateful for this support! üôè

Beyond Ripple's contribution, approximately $12,000 in unreleased funds from previous campaigns - sponsored
by Mercy Corps Ventures (MCV) and Arbitrum will be rolled into this new campaign, further amplifying the impact.

In this blog post, we will explore the details of the new campaign.

## ‚ú® About the campaign

In our 5th campaign, we remain dedicated to providing anticipatory cash transfers to pastoral communities
in Kenya which are disproportionately affected by climate-change-induced drought.

### Context

Pastoral communities in Kenya live a nomadic lifestyle, grazing animals on open-access pastures and migrating with them in
response to seasonal variations. Livestock and livestock products serve as their primary sources of income and food.

However, changing weather patterns induced by climate change are threatening the livelihoods of these communities. Over the past decade,
Kenya has experienced severe droughts which have decimated the pastoralists' livestock and put the pastoral communities at risk of starvation.

#### Seasonal patterns

To understand how climate change affects these communities and how our campaign can help, it's important to understand
the seasonal patterns in Kenya and their impact on pastoralist livelihoods.

Kenya's climate naturally fluctuates between rainy and dry seasons. Rainfall during the rainy season
stimulates vegetation growth, which provides necessary pasture for livestock in the coming dry season.
**Consequently, sufficient vegetation and fodder at the end of the rainy season are crucial for sustaining livestock and,
by extension, the livelihoods of pastoral communities throughout the subsequent dry season.**

The **long rains** season begins in mid-March and lasts until May/June, followed by a predominantly dry period
until October, during which vegetation levels gradually decline. The **short rains** arrive in mid-October and
continue through November and December, leading into a hot, typically rainless dry season lasting until March.

The different seasonal phases and the average vegetation conditions during those phases are illustrated below
(green indicating improved vegetation during rainy seasons and orange indicating declining vegetation during
dry seasons):

</div>

### Campaign goal

The campaign's objective is to assess vegetation conditions using the [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_Difference_Vegetation_Index) (NDVI)
end of May 2025, where the NDVI typically peaks (see section on payoff profile calibration below), and disburse
funds to participating pastoralists if the NDVI at the end of this period suggests insufficient vegetation to support
livestock during the subsequent dry season.

Compared to our previous campaigns and thanks to Ripple's support, we increased our **fundraising target to $40,000**,
which will provide drought relief of **$75 to 533 pastoralists** residing in the Kenyan Counties Kajiado and Laikipia (North)
in the event of drought, **sufficient to sustain one livestock for six months**. Contributions will be split 50/50 between the
two regions.

The locations of the two counties involved are highlighted in below map:

### How it works

1. The DIVA Donate team establishes a blockchain-based programmatic escrow, defining immutable triggers and payout conditions,
including the drought indicator metric (NDVI in our case), expiration, and payoff profile, all transparently recorded
and verifiable on the blockchain.
2. Donors deposit RLUSD into the escrow, committing to the pre-defined payout conditions.
3. Once the campaign expires, an oracle reports the NDVI value as of 31 May 2025:
   * If the NDVI indicates drought conditions, the payout is automatically released to beneficiaries.
   * If drought conditions are not met, participants can withdraw their funds and roll them into future campaigns. 

The possibility to claim back unreleased funds and amplify the impact by redeploying them into future campaigns is one of the key
features of the DIVA Donate platform. To illustrate, of the $20'000 initially deposited during the MCV pilot in Q4 2023, $8'400
remained unreleased. These funds have since been redeployed in multiple campaigns, including Mar-May 2024, Oct-Dec 2024, and
Mar-May 2025, **providing free drought insurance for pastoralists for four seasons**.


## üßë‚Äçüéì Calibrating the donation release profile

We continue to rely on [FEWS NDVI data](https://earlywarning.usgs.gov/fews/product/902#documentation) as our trigger metric due 
to its resilience against cloud coverage and atmospheric contamination. Its public availability also allows for transparent 
verification by all stakeholders. 

Our methodology to determine NDVI-based payout conditions remains consistent with previous campaigns. Specifically, we **analyzed
historical NDVI values at the end of May**, marking the end of the long rain season, and **correlated them with on-ground assessments**
from the [National Drought Management Authority](https://knowledgeweb.ndma.go.ke/Public/Resources/ResourceDetails.aspx?doc=3e0a4f40-b6a7-4393-9296-be1b2a972e73) (NDMA) reports for the first two months of the subsequent dry season. A
detailed analysis for both counties is provided below.

### Kajiado

#### Historical NDVI trends

Examining 13 years of historical NDVI data (2012-2024) reveals the seasonality pattern mentioned earlier: an increase of vegetation
during the long rain season (March-May), with a peak in May, followed by a decline over the subsequent months.

<div style={{ marginTop: '-1rem', fontSize: '0.8rem' }}>
_**Figure 4:** NDVI on 31 May for the years 2012-2024 for Kajiado county._
</div>

Historically, the NDVI levels on 31 May in Kajiado ranged between **0.45 in 2014**, and **0.74 in 2018**, with an average NDVI value of 0.60.

#### On-ground drought assessment reports

To assess which NDVI levels are associated with drought stress in the subsequent dry period, we examined the NDMA reports for
June and July for the years with the five lowest recorded NDVI values: 2014, 2015, 2017, 2022, and 2023.

The vegetation health map, included in the NDMA reports, indicates that moderate drought conditions were present in June and July
of 2014, 2017, and 2022, while 2015 and 2023 experienced normal vegetation levels.

_**Figure 5:** The VCI measures the average NDVI over a 3-month period, mapping the current vegetation health to its historical
range, expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%. Lower VCI values indicate that vegetation health is near the historical
minimum, whereas higher values indicate levels closer to the historical maximum. More specifically, VCI values below 20% mark
severe drought conditions (highlighted by a red box), values between 20% and 35% indicate moderate drought (highlighted by a
yellow box), and values above 35% reflect normal to optimal vegetation conditions (highlighted by a green box). The presence
of yellow or red boxes during the dry season months June, July, August, and September, suggests insufficient vegetation build-up
during the preceding rainy season. Source: [NDMA Report Kajiado, December 2024](https://knowledgeweb.ndma.go.ke/Content/LibraryDocuments/Kajiado_DEW_Bulletin_December_202420250110114339.pdf)_

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

These findings indicate that NDVI values of 0.50 or lower are associated with increased drought stress, while values at or above
0.56 indicate normal vegetation and pasture conditions.

#### Donation release profile

Based on these insights, the donation release profile was structured as follows:

<table style={{ borderCollapse: 'collapse', width: '100%' }}>
  <thead>
    <tr style={{ backgroundColor: '#f5f5f5' }}>
      <th>NDVI range</th>
      <th>Payout description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>NDVI ‚â§ 0.50</b></td>
      <td>100% payout to beneficiaries (observed in 2014, 2017, and 2022)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>NDVI ‚â• 0.56</b></td>
      <td>0% payout (indicative of normal conditions, e.g. in 2015 & 2023)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>NDVI between 0.50 and 0.56</b></td>
      <td>Linear payout scale to create a more equitable payout structure due to the lack of on-ground reports for values in that range; e.g. 50% payout at NDVI = 0.53</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The payout profile is depicted below _(Note: For technical reasons, the NDVI value is shifted by +1 for final calculations)_:

### Laikipia

#### Historical NDVI trends

The historical NDVI patterns for Laikipia are similar to Kajiado and depicted below:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/Images/posts/250223 FEWS Laikipia_not_annotated.jpg" />
</p>
<div style={{ marginTop: '-1rem', fontSize: '0.8rem' }}>

<div style={{ marginTop: '-1rem', fontSize: '0.8rem' }}>
_**Figure 8:** NDVI on 31 May for the years 2012-2024 for Laikipia county._
</div>

The years with the lowest and highest NDVI values on 31 May (0.45 in 2014 and 0.74 in 2018) are the same as for Kajiado. However,
Laikipia's average NDVI of 0.63 is slightly higher than Kajiado's 0.60, suggesting generally better vegetation conditions at the
end of the long rains season.

#### On-ground drought assessment reports

To identify the NDVI levels that are associated with drought stress in Laikipia, we took the same approach as for Kajiado and
analyzed NDMA June and July reports in the six lowest NDVI years: 2014, 2017, 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023.

The vegetation health map for Laikipia (North) suggests that in 2014, 2017, 2021, and 2022, the region has experienced drought stress,
while in 2019 and 2023 it quickly normalized. Notably, 2014, 2017, and 2022 have also been drought stress years in Kajiado.

</table>

These findings indicate that NDVI values of 0.54 or lower are associated with increased drought stress, while values at or above
0.64 indicate normal vegetation and pasture conditions. In 2021 (0.60), the vegetation conditions were classified as normal,
however, the pasture conditions remained below normal. This implies that NDVI values slightly higher (e.g., 0.62) would also
correspond to adequate pasture conditions.
