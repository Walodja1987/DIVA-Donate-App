We are excited to announce the [5th iteration of the DIVA Donate campaign](https://www.divadonate.xyz/campaign/pastoralists-5) focused on using web3 
technology in delivering anticipatory cash transfers to pastoral communities in Kenya ahead of drought. 

We are particularly thrilled to share that this coming season's campaign will take place in partnership with Ripple and will utilize Ripple's
new stablecoin, [RLUSD](https://etherscan.io/token/0x8292Bb45bf1Ee4d140127049757C2E0fF06317eD), on Ethereum as the payout token, demonstrating its applicability in humanitarian
aid and disaster relief. The collaboration with Ripple is a testament to the value of our work and the
community's trust in our mission to become the most effective and efficient platform for disaster relief,
powered by blockchain technology. We are deeply honored and incredibly grateful for this support! üôè

Beyond Ripple's contribution, approximately $12,000 in unreleased funds from previous campaigns - sponsored
by Mercy Corps Ventures (MCV) and Arbitrum will be rolled into this new campaign, further amplifying the impact.

In this blog post, we will explore the details of the new campaign.

## ‚ú® About the campaign

In our 5th campaign, we remain dedicated to providing anticipatory cash transfers to pastoral communities
in Kenya which are disproportionately affected by climate-change-induced drought.

### Context

Pastoral communities in Kenya live a nomadic lifestyle, grazing animals on open-access pastures and migrating with them in
response to seasonal variations. Livestock and livestock products serve as their primary sources of income and food.

However, changing weather patterns induced by climate change are threatening the livelihoods of these communities. Over the past decade,
Kenya has experienced severe droughts which have decimated the pastoralists' livestock and put the pastoral communities at risk of starvation.

Kenya's climate naturally fluctuates between rainy and dry seasons. Rainfall during the rainy season
stimulates vegetation growth, which provides necessary pasture for livestock in the coming dry season.
**Sufficient vegetation and fodder at the end of the rainy season are crucial for sustaining livestock and,
by extension, the livelihoods of pastoral communities throughout the subsequent dry season.**

The **long rains** season begins in mid-March and lasts until May/June, followed by a predominantly dry period
until October, during which vegetation levels gradually decline. The **short rains** arrive in mid-October and
continue through November and December, leading into a hot, typically rainless dry season lasting until March.
The start and end of the rainy seasons may experience slight variations of two to three weeks.

The different seasonal phases and the average vegetation conditions during those phases are illustrated below
(green indicating improved vegetation during rainy seasons and orange indicating declining vegetation during
dry seasons):

</div>

### Campaign goal

The campaign's objective is to assess vegetation conditions using the [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_Difference_Vegetation_Index) (NDVI)
end of May 2025, where the NDVI typically peaks (see section on payoff profile calibration below), and disburse
funds to participating pastoralists if the NDVI at the end of this period suggests insufficient vegetation to support
livestock during the subsequent dry season.

Compared to our previous campaigns and thanks to Ripple's support, we increased our **fundraising target to $40,000**,
which will provide drought relief of **$75 to 533 pastoralists** residing in the northern part of the Kenyan County Laikipia
in the event of drought, **sufficient to sustain one livestock for six months**.

The location of the Laikipia County is highlighted in below map:

</div>

Laikipia County has diverse climatic zones due to its varying altitude and topography. The northern region is predominantly arid and semi-arid,
with low rainfall and frequent droughts, and is mainly used for pastoralism and wildlife conservation. In contrast, the central and southern parts
transition into more fertile highlands with higher rainfall, cooler temperatures, and richer vegetation, supporting agriculture and livestock farming.

</div>

### How it works

1. The DIVA Donate team established a blockchain-based programmatic escrow, defining immutable triggers and payout conditions (see payoff calibration section below),
including the drought indicator metric (NDVI in our case), expiration, and payoff profile, all transparently recorded
and verifiable on the blockchain.
2. Donors deposit RLUSD into the escrow, committing to the pre-defined payout conditions.
3. Once the campaign expires, an oracle reports the NDVI value as of 31 May 2025:
   * If the NDVI indicates drought conditions, the payout is automatically released to beneficiaries.
   * If drought conditions are not met, participants can withdraw their funds and roll them into future campaigns. 

The possibility to claim back unreleased funds and amplify the impact by redeploying them into future campaigns is one of the key
features of the DIVA Donate platform. To illustrate, of the $20'000 initially deposited during the MCV pilot in Q4 2023, $8'400
remained unreleased. These funds have since been redeployed in multiple campaigns, including Mar-May 2024, Oct-Dec 2024, and
Mar-May 2025, **providing free drought insurance for pastoralists for four seasons**.


## üßë‚Äçüéì Calibrating the donation release profile

We continue to rely on [FEWS NDVI data](https://earlywarning.usgs.gov/fews/product/902#documentation) as our trigger metric due 
to its resilience against cloud coverage and atmospheric contamination. Its public availability also allows for transparent 
verification by all stakeholders. 

Our methodology to determine NDVI-based payout conditions remains consistent with previous campaigns. Specifically, we **analyzed
historical NDVI values at the end of May**, marking the end of the long rain season, and **correlated them with on-ground assessments**
from the [National Drought Management Authority](https://knowledgeweb.ndma.go.ke/Public/Resources/ResourceDetails.aspx?doc=3e0a4f40-b6a7-4393-9296-be1b2a972e73) (NDMA) reports for the first two months of the subsequent dry season.
A detailed analysis for the target region is provided below.


### Laikipia North

#### Historical NDVI trends

Examining 13 years of historical NDVI data (2012-2024) reveals the seasonality pattern mentioned earlier: an increase of vegetation during
the long rain season (March-May), with a peak at the end of May, followed by a decline over the subsequent months.

<div style={{ marginTop: '-1rem', fontSize: '0.8rem' }}>
_**Figure 5:** NDVI on 31 May for the years 2012-2024 for Laikipia North._
</div>

Historically, the NDVI levels on 31 May in Laikipia North ranged between 0.41 in 2022, and 0.75 in 2024, with an average NDVI value of 0.61.

#### On-ground drought assessment reports

To assess which NDVI levels are associated with drought stress in the subsequent dry period, we examined the NDMA reports for June and July
for the years with the six lowest recorded NDVI years: 2014, 2017, 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023.

The vegetation health map for Laikipia North suggests that in 2014, 2017, 2021, and 2022, the region has experienced prolonged drought stress,
characterized by moderate to severe drought conditions lasting at least four months after the onset of the dry period in June. In 2019, moderate
drought stress was observed only in June, with conditions normalizing in the following months. In 2023, normal vegetation appeared normal in June
and July, but deteriorated between August and October.

_**Figure 6:** The VCI measures the average NDVI over a 3-month period, mapping the current vegetation health to its historical range, expressed as a
percentage from 0% to 100%. Lower VCI values indicate that vegetation health is near the historical minimum, whereas higher values indicate levels
closer to the historical maximum. More specifically, VCI values below 20% mark severe drought conditions (highlighted by a red box), values between
20% and 35% indicate moderate drought (highlighted by a yellow box), and values above 35% reflect normal to optimal vegetation conditions
(highlighted by a green box). The presence of yellow or red boxes during the dry season months June, July, August, and September, suggests
insufficient vegetation build-up during the preceding rainy season. Vegetation map, see Figure 5 for details. Source: [NDMA Report Laikipia,

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

These findings indicate that NDVI values of 0.52 or lower are associated with increased drought stress, while values at or above 0.60
indicate normal vegetation and pasture conditions. Since on-ground data is unavailable for NDVI values between 0.52 (2019) and 0.57
(2021), it is reasonable to infer that values at or below 0.55 (approximately the midpoint) are also likely associated with drought stress.
Further, using the long-term average of 0.61 as the level indicating normal vegetation conditions provides a buffer to account for variability.

#### Donation release profile

Based on the on-ground drought assessments, the donation release profile for Laikipia is structured as follows:

<table style={{ borderCollapse: 'collapse', width: '100%' }}>
  <thead>
    <tr style={{ backgroundColor: '#f5f5f5' }}>
      <th>NDVI range</th>
      <th>Payout description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>NDVI ‚â§ 0.55</b></td>
      <td>100% payout to beneficiaries (observed in 2014, 2017, 2019, and 2022)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>NDVI ‚â• 0.61</b></td>
      <td>0% payout (observed in 2015 and 2016, for instance)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>NDVI between 0.55 and 0.61</b></td>
      <td>Linear payout scale, ensuring a gradual increase in payouts with increasing drought stress; in 2021 (NDVI: 0.57), 67% of the contributed funds would have been disbursed to pastoralists.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The payout profile is depicted below _(Note: For technical reasons, the NDVI value is shifted by +1 for final calculations)_:
