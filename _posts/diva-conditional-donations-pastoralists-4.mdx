We are excited to announce the launch of the 4th iteration of the DIVA Donate campaign, focused on providing 
anticipatory cash transfers to pastoralist communities in Kenya ahead of drought.

We are particularly thrilled to share that DIVA Donate has been selected as one of the recipients of the 
[Arbitrum ReFi grant](https://app.charmverse.io/refi-in-arbitrum-grants/refi-in-arbitrum-grants-program-overview-03828600111718794). This grant has allowed us to further enhance the DIVA Donate platform and to seed 
this new campaign. The grant is a testament to the value of our work and the community‚Äôs trust 
in our mission to become the most effective and efficient platform for disaster relief, powered 
by blockchain technology. We are deeply honored and incredibly grateful for this support! üôè

In this blog post, we will explore the details of the new campaign and discuss the updates made to the 
DIVA Donate app, all made possible by the generous Arbitrum grant.

## ‚ú® About the campaign

In our 4th campaign, we remain dedicated to providing anticipatory cash transfers to pastoralist communities in Kenya, specifically in Kajiado county, which are disproportionately affected by climate-change-induced drought.

The campaign‚Äôs objective is to assess vegetation health using the [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_Difference_Vegetation_Index) (NDVI) following 
the October-November-December 2024 rainy season and disburse funds to participating pastoralists if the NDVI at 
the end of this period suggests insufficient vegetation, due to lack of rainfall, to support livestock during 
the subsequent dry season.

With a fundraising target of $15‚Äô000, our goal is to distribute drought relief of $75 each to 200 pastoralists 
in the event of drought, sufficient to sustain one livestock for six months.

From the previous campaign, $8‚Äô632.60 of the Mercy Corps Funds remained unreleased and will be rolled in this new campaign, highlighting the amplified impact of every dollar contributed. 
Additionally, an approximate $2‚Äô500 will be contributed from the Arbitrum grant.

## üßë‚Äçüéì Calibrating the donation release profile

We continue to rely on [FEWS NDVI data](https://earlywarning.usgs.gov/fews/product/902#documentation) as our trigger metric due 
to its resilience against cloud coverage and atmospheric contamination. Its public availability also allows for transparent 
verification by all stakeholders. 

We employed the same methodology as in our previous campaign to determine NDVI thresholds that indicate drought conditions. 
Specifically, we analyzed historical NDVI values at the end of December, coinciding with the end of the rainy season, 
and correlated these with on-the-ground assessments from the [National Drought Management Authority](https://knowledgeweb.ndma.go.ke/Public/Resources/ResourceDetails.aspx?doc=3e0a4f40-b6a7-4393-9296-be1b2a972e73) (NDMA) reports 
during the first two months of the subsequent dry season. More details are provided in the following sections.


### Historical NDVI

Looking at the historical NDVI data covering the last 12 years, a recurring pattern emerges: an increase in NDVI during 
the October-November-December rainy season, indicating improved vegetation, followed by a decline until the end of February / 
beginning of March as the dry season progresses.

_Source: [FEWS](https://earlywarning.usgs.gov/fews/ewx/index.html)_

The chart highlights the NDVI values on 31 December for each of the last 12 years, ranging between 0.40 in 2017, and 
0.75 in 2019, with an average NDVI value of 0.58. Low NDVI values imply reduced fodder and tougher survival conditions 
for pastoralists' livestock during the subsequent dry period.

### On-ground reports

To assess which NDVI levels led to drought stress in the subsequent dry period, we examined the NDMA reports for January 
and February following the years with the five lowest recorded NDVI values: 2014, 2016, 2017, 2021, and 2022. 

Here is a summary of the drought status assessments, listed in ascending order of NDVI:
* **2017 (NDVI: 0.40)**: The [January 2018](https://knowledgeweb.ndma.go.ke/Public/Resources/ResourceDetails.aspx?doc=f9a0c0f0-bfd3-4fd2-a9ad-b2c510772d4d) report indicated a drought status of Alarm. The report for February was not available.
* **2022 (NDVI: 0.45)**: Reports from [January](https://knowledgeweb.ndma.go.ke/Public/Resources/ResourceDetails.aspx?doc=9d41dd3b-5fd3-4f26-9672-11ab929911e5) and [February 2023](https://knowledgeweb.ndma.go.ke/Public/Resources/ResourceDetails.aspx?doc=0af05e9a-1803-42f4-923f-7f4749c62b18) indicated a drought status of Alarm.
* **2016 (NDVI: 0.50)**: Reports from [January](https://knowledgeweb.ndma.go.ke/Public/Resources/ResourceDetails.aspx?doc=ad94c43f-51a4-4de3-ab46-6c1fa11beadb) and [February 2017](https://knowledgeweb.ndma.go.ke/Public/Resources/ResourceDetails.aspx?doc=66602939-9071-4374-80f4-6c63ccdd8643) indicated a drought status ranging from Alert to Alarm.
* **2014 (NDVI: 0.52)**: Reports from [January](https://knowledgeweb.ndma.go.ke/Public/Resources/ResourceDetails.aspx?doc=f22a606f-0a0d-4ed2-91f1-af116f9ae3c6) and [February 2015](https://knowledgeweb.ndma.go.ke/Public/Resources/ResourceDetails.aspx?doc=f22a606f-0a0d-4ed2-91f1-af116f9ae3c6) indicated a drought status of Alert.
* **2021 (NDVI: 0.53)**: Reports from [January](https://knowledgeweb.ndma.go.ke/Public/Resources/ResourceDetails.aspx?doc=4fd1bea0-2171-4cfc-83ac-2144b4c7c215) and [February 2022](https://knowledgeweb.ndma.go.ke/Public/Resources/ResourceDetails.aspx?doc=a96eecba-dc6c-457d-a224-5ae3a6db0c67) indicated a drought status of Alert, but some parts of the region showing normal conditions.

Based on these observations, implementing a donation profile that pays out 100% of the contributed funds for NDVI values of 0.45 
and below (2017 and 2022), 50% for values at 0.50 (2016), and no payout for values at or above 0.52, seems to be a prudent 
approach. The payout profile is depicted below (note that the NDVI value was shifted by +1 for technical reasons):

Any funds that remain unreleased can be reclaimed by the original contributor and redeployed into future campaigns.
