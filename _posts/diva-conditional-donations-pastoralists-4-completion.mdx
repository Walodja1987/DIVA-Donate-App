We are excited to announce the successful conclusion of our [4th campaign](https://www.divadonate.xyz/posts/diva-conditional-donations-pastoralists-4)
to provide anticipatory cash transfers to pastoralist communities in Kenya. **Due to favorable vegetation conditions, no payouts were triggered** during this campaign.

Participants can reclaim their contributions by following the steps outlined in [this video](https://shorturl.at/uBHLN). These funds can be redeposited 
in future campaigns to amplify their impact.

Let‚Äôs dive into the details and key learnings from this campaign.

## ‚ú® Campaign overview
The primary goal of this campaign was to **assess vegetation health** using [NDVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_difference_vegetation_index#:~:text=The%20normalized%20difference%20vegetation%20index,%3A%20red%20and%20near%2Dinfrared.)
(Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) following the Oct-Dec 2024 rainy season in Kenya‚Äôs Kajiado county and **disburse funds to participating pastoralists** if the NDVI at the end of this period suggests
**insufficient vegetation to support livestock** during the upcoming dry season.

More details can be found in the [original campaign announcement](https://www.divadonate.xyz/posts/diva-conditional-donations-pastoralists-4).

## ‚ô•Ô∏è Campaign contributions
A total of **$12‚Äô275** was contributed to the campaign, providing **$75 drought coverage** to each of the **163 participating pastoralists**.
Key funding sources included:
* **$8‚Äô633** in unreleased Mercy Corps Venture funds rolled over from the previous campaign.
* **$91** generated yield by lending these funds on [Aave](https://aave.com/) during the transition period between campaigns.
* **$2‚Äô597** grant from [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/).

## üå± NDVI result
On **31 December 2024**, the NDVI value was recorded at **0.69** (reported as 1.69 for technical reasons), which **exceeded the threshold of 0.52 required for payouts**.

</p>

To put it into context, the NDVI value is:
* 19% above the 2012-2021 mean (0.58).
* 33% above the 2003-2022 mean (0.52).
* The second-highest value recorded since 2012 (the highest was 0.75 in 2019).

## üí∞ Fund rollover
Since no payouts were triggered, the contributions from Mercy Corps Ventures and Arbitrum will be reclaimed and rolled over into the Mar-May 2025 campaign.
This demonstrates how every dollar contributed multiplies its impact through our need-based approach, ensuring funds are donated only when they are most needed.

## üéñÔ∏è Participant reward
As a token of appreciation, all participants received a digital certificate (a so-called POAP), to commemorate their contribution. Donations of $75 or more got the golden-ring POAP. Smaller contributions received the silver POAP.

## üìö Key learning
In December, we noticed that FEWSNET had stopped reporting the NDVI value that our campaign relied on. After reaching out, their team quickly acknowledged and resolved the issue.
This experience highlighted that even when using a decentralized oracle like [Tellor Protocol](https://tellor.io/), relying on a single data provider does not eliminate the centralization risk.

One potential solution could involve creating a public script to enable independent calculation of the NDVI value. However, the FEWSNET team explained that their NDVI products require complex systems, including supercomputers for data smoothing, making replication on standard hardware difficult.

To strengthen resilience in future campaigns, we will explore fallback options to address potential disruptions in the main data source.

## üìà Impact statistics (since inception)
* **$46,510** has been **contributed** across four campaigns.
* **$11,744** (25%) was **distributed** to beneficiaries (during the Q4 2023 MCV pilot campaign).
* On average, **148 pastoralists** were protected per rainy season, with free coverage worth **$78** each and total payouts averaging **$20**.

## ü§ù Join the cause

The DIVA Donate team is **actively seeking partners** who share our vision of harnessing blockchain technology to provide effective support to vulnerable communities affected by climate change. Given the versatile nature of DIVA Protocol, the smart contract powering DIVA Donate, the donation payout can be linked to virtually any metric and adapted to many different use cases.

If you represent a charity or NGO passionate about this concept, [reach out](mailto:wladimir.weinbender@divatech.ch) and join forces to provide more efficient and effective support to those in need.

## üåñ Conclusion
The successful completion of the 4th DIVA Donate campaign underscores our ongoing commitment to increasing the climate resilience of vulnerable communities through blockchain technology.

We are grateful for the support and generosity of all contributors. üôè

Stay tuned for the 5th campaign (Mar-May 2025), which will feature a groundbreaking enhancement that multiplies every dollar contributed into more than one dollar donated when drought conditions are met.
