							{' '}							
							Pastoralists are people whose primary source of income and food is livestock and livestock products. 
							Pastoralist communities live a nomadic lifestyle which entails grazing animals on open-access 
							pastures and migrating with them in response to seasonal variations.
							<br />
							<br />
							Changing weather patterns induced by climate change are threatening the livelihoods of pastoralists communities
							in the eastern Horn of Africa. The region is experiencing one of the worst droughts which already resulted in the loss of over 7 million livestock 
							and put millions at risk of starvation in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia. 
							<br />
							<br />
							The goal of the campaign is to provide financial support to enrolled pastoralists in the Kenyan counties Kajiado and Laikipia if the pasture
							conditions, as measured by remote-sensed technology, are deemed distressful.

						Trigger metric
					</div>
					<ul className="list-disc mb-8">
						The pasture conditions are assessed using an indicator called NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index).
						The NDVI is a widely-used metric for quantifying the health and density of vegetation using sensor data, 
						and is a reasonable metric to evaluate the on-ground effects of drought since vegetation density typically 
						tracks rainfall performance.						
						<br></br>
						<br></br>
						For this campaign, the average NDVI observed between 1st October and
						22th December 2023 is used and reported by the Shamba oracle on 2nd
						January to ensure full data coverage of the observation period. The
						NDVI is shifted by 1 for technical reasons.The donation release curves for each pilot location (Kajiado and Laikipia)
						were derived based on in-depth analysis of historical NDVI patterns.
