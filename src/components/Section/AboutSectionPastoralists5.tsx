							{' '}							
							Pastoralist communities live a nomadic lifestyle, grazing animals on open-access 
							pastures and migrating with them in response to seasonal variations.
							Livestock and livestock products serve as their primary sources of income and food. 
							<br />
							<br />
							However, changing weather patterns induced by climate change are threatening the livelihoods of these communities
							in the eastern Horn of Africa. The region is experiencing one of the worst droughts which already resulted in the loss of over 7 million livestock 
							and put millions at risk of starvation in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia. 
							<br />

						 (NDVI) following the 
							October-November-December 2024 rainy season and disburse funds to participating pastoralists if the NDVI at the end of this 
							period suggests insufficient vegetation to support livestock during the subsequent dry season.
							The target cover amount of $75 per pastoralist intends to subsidize 
							the provision of food for one livestock animal over a period of six months.

						The pasture condition is assessed using an indicator called NDVI (

						The NDVI is a widely-used metric for quantifying the health and density of vegetation using sensor data.
						It serves as a reasonable metric for assessing drought as vegetation density generally correlates with rainfall patterns.

						The donation release profile has been derived by analyzing historical NDVI trends during drought years (2014, 2017, 2022), ensuring a tailored response to drought conditions.
